# Product Context: Scalable API Service

## 1. Why This Project Exists
This project exists to provide a robust, scalable, and cost-effective backend API service for managing user-generated content, specifically Posts and Tags, along with User profiles. The need arises from a common requirement in modern web and mobile applications for a reliable system to handle these core entities with proper access control and a good developer experience.

## 2. Problems It Solves
- **Complexity of Managing User Data:** Simplifies the backend logic required for CRUD operations on Users, Posts, and Tags.
- **Scalability Concerns:** Addresses the challenge of building a system that can handle fluctuating user traffic without over-provisioning resources or suffering performance degradation.
- **Development Overhead:** Reduces the time and effort needed to set up a secure and maintainable API by leveraging serverless technologies and Infrastructure as Code (IaC).
- **Security and Access Control:** Provides a clear framework for managing data privacy and access permissions, ensuring users can only access and modify data they are authorized to.
- **Cost Management:** Aims to minimize operational costs by using a serverless architecture that scales with demand and benefits from pay-per-use pricing models.
- **Developer Experience:** Enhances developer productivity by providing a TypeScript-based codebase, a local development environment with API simulation, an interactive API explorer (with documentation generated from code metadata), an efficient `pnpm` package manager, and a Test-Driven Development (TDD) approach ensuring high-quality, well-tested code.

## 3. How It Should Work
The system will function as a RESTful API service:
- **User Authentication:** Users will sign up and log in via Amazon Cognito. Successful authentication will provide a JWT token for accessing protected API endpoints.
- **Entity Management:**
    - **Users:** After sign-up, a user profile is created in DynamoDB. Authenticated users can retrieve and update their own profiles.
    - **Posts:** Authenticated users can create, read, update, and delete posts. Access to posts is governed by three levels: `private` (owner only), `public` (all authenticated users), and `allowed_user` (a specific list of users).
    - **Tags:** Authenticated users can create, read, update, and delete tags. Access to tags is governed by two levels: `private` (owner only for viewing and assignment) and `public` (viewable by all, assignable by any authenticated user).
- **Relationships:** Users own Posts and Tags. Posts can be associated with multiple Tags.
- **Access Control Enforcement:** The API will rigorously enforce the defined access rules for all operations on Posts and Tags. For instance, a user cannot update a post they do not own. When assigning tags to a post, the user must either own the tag (if private) or the tag must be public.
- **Local Development:** Developers will be able to run a local simulation of the API, including a local DynamoDB instance and an API explorer UI (with documentation derived from code metadata), to facilitate rapid development and testing. The development process will follow Test-Driven Development (TDD).
- **Programmatic Access (Future):** Users will eventually be able to generate Personal Access Tokens (PATs) to authorize programmatic access to their account data, enabling integrations with external services or tools like MCP servers.

## 4. User Experience Goals
While this is a backend API, the "user" can be considered both the end-user of an application built on this API and the developer working with the API.

### For End-Users (of applications using this API):
- **Security and Privacy:** Confidence that their data (posts, tags, profile information) is secure and only accessible according to defined permissions.
- **Reliability:** Consistent and dependable access to their data and application features powered by the API. This includes clear and understandable error messages if something goes wrong.
- **Performance:** Fast response times when interacting with features that rely on the API (e.g., loading posts, saving content), achieved through optimized backend resources and caching strategies where appropriate.

### For Developers (using this API):
- **Ease of Integration:** Clear API documentation (generated from code metadata and available via API Explorer), well-defined endpoints, and standardized error responses (HTTP codes and descriptive messages) make it straightforward to integrate the API into frontend applications or other services.
- **Productivity:** A local development environment that closely mirrors production, strong typing (TypeScript), efficient package management (`pnpm`), and code quality tools (ESLint, Prettier) allow for efficient development. The exclusive use of Test-Driven Development (TDD) ensures that features are built correctly from the start and are accompanied by comprehensive tests.
- **Maintainability:** A well-structured, type-safe, and thoroughly tested (due to TDD) codebase, along with infrastructure defined as code (AWS CDK), make the system easier to understand, modify, and extend over time.
- **Scalability Confidence:** Assurance that the API is built on a scalable architecture, reducing concerns about future growth.
- **Cost Transparency:** Understanding that the underlying architecture is designed for cost-effectiveness, with tools and practices in place for monitoring and optimizing costs.
- **Observability:** Access to comprehensive logging (CloudWatch Logs), metrics (CloudWatch Metrics), and tracing (AWS X-Ray) to monitor API health, diagnose issues quickly, and understand system behavior, contributing to a more stable and reliable service.
- **Extensibility (Future via PATs):** For developers, the ability to leverage Personal Access Tokens for programmatic access will open up opportunities for building extended functionalities and integrations (e.g., MCP servers for LLM features) on top of the user's data, with user consent and control.
