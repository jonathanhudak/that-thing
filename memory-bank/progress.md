# Project Progress: Scalable API Service

## 1. Current Status

- **Phase:** Implementation - Core API Endpoints.
- **Overall Progress:** Project Skeleton: 100% complete. Memory Bank Documentation: 100% Architecturally Enhanced. Code Implementation: Cognito setup 100% complete, DynamoDB setup 100% complete, Basic Observability (Alarms) setup 100% complete, GET /v1/me API endpoint infrastructure setup 100% complete.
- **Date:** 2025-05-16 (Updated to reflect GET /v1/me API endpoint infrastructure completion)

## 2. What Works

- **Memory Bank Core Files (Architecturally Enhanced):**
  - All core files (`projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`, `activeContext.md`, `progress.md`) are updated with detailed architectural decisions.
- **Initial Idea Document:** `docs/initial-idea.md`.
- **Root README:** `README.md`.
- **Project Skeleton & Tooling:**
  - `pnpm` initialized (`package.json`).
  - Root TypeScript configured (`tsconfig.json`) for `src/` directory.
  - AWS CDK project initialized in `infra/` (with its own `package.json`, `tsconfig.json`).
  - `src/` directory created for application code.
  - ESLint configured (`.eslintrc.js`).
  - Prettier configured (`.prettierrc.json`).
  - Husky and lint-staged configured for pre-commit hooks.
  - Basic CI pipeline established (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) with linting, formatting checks, type checks, and CDK build.
- **Implemented Infrastructure:**
  - AWS Cognito User Pool and User Pool Client for authentication (CDK constructs and tests implemented).
  - AWS DynamoDB single-table with 'PK'/'SK' primary key and 4 Global Secondary Indexes (UserPostsIndex, AccessTypePostsIndex, AllowedUserPostsIndex, TagPostsSortedIndex) for flexible data querying (CDK constructs and tests implemented).
  - AWS CloudWatch Alarms for key Cognito (SignInThrottles) and DynamoDB (WriteThrottleEvents) metrics.
  - API Gateway REST API, Lambda function for `GET /v1/me` (User Profile), and Cognito Authorizer integration (CDK constructs and tests implemented; Lambda logic is placeholder).

## 3. What's Left to Build (High-Level Roadmap from `activeContext.md`)

- **DONE:** Validate Enhanced Architecture.
- **DONE:** Detailed Design Spike (API Gateway cache TTLs, CloudWatch alarm thresholds, DynamoDB GSI for Tag-Post relationship).
- **DONE:** Project Skeleton & Setup (TDD Approach, reflecting enhanced architecture):
  - Initialize project with `pnpm` (`package.json`).
  - Configure TypeScript (`tsconfig.json`).
  - Initialize AWS CDK project structure (`infra/`, `src/`, `tests/`).
  - Set up ESLint, Prettier, Husky, Lint-Staged.
  - Implement CI/CD pipeline basics (e.g., GitHub Actions) including linting, formatting, and initial test runs.
- **Core Infrastructure & Features (TDD Approach):**
  - **DONE: Authentication (Cognito):** Implement CDK constructs.
  - **DONE: Database (DynamoDB):** Implement CDK constructs for the single table with defined GSIs.
  - **DONE: Observability Setup (CloudWatch, X-Ray):** Implement basic CloudWatch Alarms. (X-Ray tracing enabled for API Gateway and initial Lambda).
  - **DONE: Core API (User Profile - e.g., `GET /v1/me`):** Implement Lambda, API Gateway endpoint, IAM roles (Infrastructure part).
  - **NEXT: Lambda Logic Implementation (User Profile - `GET /v1/me`):** Implement actual logic in `src/handlers/user/profile.ts` to fetch user data from DynamoDB.
  - **NEXT: Core API (Posts & Tags):** Continue with other entities (Posts, Tags) - infrastructure and Lambda logic, following the TDD cycle, incorporating detailed access control, error handling, and other defined patterns.
- **Extended Testing:** Integrate load, security, and performance testing into the CI/CD pipeline.
- **Future Features (Post-MVP - Design Phase):**
  - **Personal Access Token (PAT) System:** High-level design and requirements gathering for PAT generation, storage, validation, and management APIs.

## 4. Known Issues / Blockers

- None at this exact moment, as development has not yet commenced. Potential future issues are detailed in the "Risks and Mitigations" section of `projectbrief.md`.
- The `pnpm test` script in the root `package.json` currently echoes an error; actual tests need to be written.
- The CI pipeline's type check step for `src/` (`pnpm exec tsc --noEmit --project tsconfig.json`) will report "No inputs were found" until files are added to `src/`. This is expected.

## 5. Evolution of Project Decisions

- **2025-05-15 (Initial Setup):**
  - **Decision:** Initialize the Memory Bank.
  - **Rationale:** Establish a documented foundation.
  - **Impact:** Core Memory Bank files created.
- **2025-05-15 (User Feedback Integration):**
  - **Decisions:** Adopt `pnpm`, exclusive TDD, metadata-driven API docs.
  - **Rationale:** User preferences and requirements.
  - **Impact:** Core Memory Bank files updated.
- **2025-05-16 (Solutions Architect Review Integration):**
  - **Decision:** Incorporate comprehensive architectural enhancements based on `research/solutions-architect-findings-to-enhance-architecture.md`.
  - **Rationale:** To address potential gaps and ensure a robust, scalable, secure, and maintainable design before implementation, aligning with AWS best practices.
  - **Impact (Key Enhancements):**
    - **Security:** Detailed access control model (Cognito, Lambda auth logic, IAM least privilege, HTTPS), vulnerability monitoring considerations.
    - **DynamoDB Design:** Specific single-table schema with PK/SK structures, GSIs for key access patterns, and query examples.
    - **Scalability & Performance:** Strategies for Lambda optimization (provisioned concurrency, memory), DynamoDB (on-demand capacity, batch ops), API Gateway (throttling, caching).
    - **Error Handling & Resilience:** Standardized HTTP error codes, retry mechanisms for transient failures.
    - **Observability:** Comprehensive plan for logging (CloudWatch Logs), metrics (CloudWatch Metrics), alarms (CloudWatch Alarms), and tracing (AWS X-Ray).
    - **Cost Management:** Proactive monitoring with AWS Cost Explorer and Budgets.
    - **API Versioning:** Adopted path-based versioning (e.g., `/v1/`).
    - **Schema Evolution:** Planning for flexible schemas and batch migration strategies.
    - **Extended Testing:** Commitment to include load, security, and performance testing in CI/CD.
    - **Alternatives Considered:** Confirmed sticking with Lambda/DynamoDB for core functionality based on cost-effectiveness and suitability.
  - **Impact (Overall):** All core Memory Bank files (`projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`, `activeContext.md`, `progress.md`) significantly updated to reflect these detailed architectural decisions and considerations, providing a much stronger foundation for development.
- **2025-05-16 (Future Feature Identification):**
