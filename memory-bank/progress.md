# Project Progress: Scalable API Service

## 1. Current Status

- **Phase:** Implementation - Initial Infrastructure Setup.
- **Overall Progress:** Project Skeleton: 100% complete. Memory Bank Documentation: 100% Architecturally Enhanced. Code Implementation: 0%.
- **Date:** 2025-05-16 (Updated to reflect project skeleton completion)

## 2. What Works

- **Memory Bank Core Files (Architecturally Enhanced):**
  - All core files (`projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`, `activeContext.md`, `progress.md`) are updated with detailed architectural decisions.
- **Initial Idea Document:** `docs/initial-idea.md`.
- **Root README:** `README.md`.
- **Project Skeleton & Tooling:**
  - `pnpm` initialized (`package.json`).
  - Root TypeScript configured (`tsconfig.json`) for `src/` directory.
  - AWS CDK project initialized in `infra/` (with its own `package.json`, `tsconfig.json`).
  - `src/` directory created for application code.
  - ESLint configured (`.eslintrc.js`).
  - Prettier configured (`.prettierrc.json`).
  - Husky and lint-staged configured for pre-commit hooks.
  - Basic CI pipeline established (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) with linting, formatting checks, type checks, and CDK build.

## 3. What's Left to Build (High-Level Roadmap from `activeContext.md`)

- **DONE:** Validate Enhanced Architecture.
- **DONE:** Detailed Design Spike (API Gateway cache TTLs, CloudWatch alarm thresholds, DynamoDB GSI for Tag-Post relationship).
- **DONE:** Project Skeleton & Setup (TDD Approach, reflecting enhanced architecture):
  - Initialize project with `pnpm` (`package.json`).
  - Configure TypeScript (`tsconfig.json`).
  - Initialize AWS CDK project structure (`infra/`, `src/`, `tests/`).
  - Set up ESLint, Prettier, Husky, Lint-Staged.
  - Implement CI/CD pipeline basics (e.g., GitHub Actions) including linting, formatting, and initial test runs.
- **NEXT: Core Infrastructure & Features (TDD Approach):**
  - **Authentication (Cognito):** Implement CDK constructs.
  - **Database (DynamoDB):** Implement CDK constructs for the single table with defined GSIs.
  - **Observability Setup (CloudWatch, X-Ray):** Implement basic logging, metrics, and tracing setup.
  - **Core API (User Profile - e.g., `GET /v1/me`):** Implement Lambda, API Gateway endpoint, IAM roles.
  - Continue with other entities (Posts, Tags) following the TDD cycle, incorporating detailed access control, error handling, and other defined patterns.
- **Extended Testing:** Integrate load, security, and performance testing into the CI/CD pipeline.
- **Future Features (Post-MVP - Design Phase):**
  - **Personal Access Token (PAT) System:** High-level design and requirements gathering for PAT generation, storage, validation, and management APIs.

## 4. Known Issues / Blockers

- None at this exact moment, as development has not yet commenced. Potential future issues are detailed in the "Risks and Mitigations" section of `projectbrief.md`.
- The `pnpm test` script in the root `package.json` currently echoes an error; actual tests need to be written.
- The CI pipeline's type check step for `src/` (`pnpm exec tsc --noEmit --project tsconfig.json`) will report "No inputs were found" until files are added to `src/`. This is expected.

## 5. Evolution of Project Decisions

- **2025-05-15 (Initial Setup):**
  - **Decision:** Initialize the Memory Bank.
  - **Rationale:** Establish a documented foundation.
  - **Impact:** Core Memory Bank files created.
- **2025-05-15 (User Feedback Integration):**
  - **Decisions:** Adopt `pnpm`, exclusive TDD, metadata-driven API docs.
  - **Rationale:** User preferences and requirements.
  - **Impact:** Core Memory Bank files updated.
- **2025-05-16 (Solutions Architect Review Integration):**
  - **Decision:** Incorporate comprehensive architectural enhancements based on `research/solutions-architect-findings-to-enhance-architecture.md`.
  - **Rationale:** To address potential gaps and ensure a robust, scalable, secure, and maintainable design before implementation, aligning with AWS best practices.
  - **Impact (Key Enhancements):**
    - **Security:** Detailed access control model (Cognito, Lambda auth logic, IAM least privilege, HTTPS), vulnerability monitoring considerations.
    - **DynamoDB Design:** Specific single-table schema with PK/SK structures, GSIs for key access patterns, and query examples.
    - **Scalability & Performance:** Strategies for Lambda optimization (provisioned concurrency, memory), DynamoDB (on-demand capacity, batch ops), API Gateway (throttling, caching).
    - **Error Handling & Resilience:** Standardized HTTP error codes, retry mechanisms for transient failures.
    - **Observability:** Comprehensive plan for logging (CloudWatch Logs), metrics (CloudWatch Metrics), alarms (CloudWatch Alarms), and tracing (AWS X-Ray).
    - **Cost Management:** Proactive monitoring with AWS Cost Explorer and Budgets.
    - **API Versioning:** Adopted path-based versioning (e.g., `/v1/`).
    - **Schema Evolution:** Planning for flexible schemas and batch migration strategies.
    - **Extended Testing:** Commitment to include load, security, and performance testing in CI/CD.
    - **Alternatives Considered:** Confirmed sticking with Lambda/DynamoDB for core functionality based on cost-effectiveness and suitability.
  - **Impact (Overall):** All core Memory Bank files (`projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`, `activeContext.md`, `progress.md`) significantly updated to reflect these detailed architectural decisions and considerations, providing a much stronger foundation for development.
- **2025-05-16 (Future Feature Identification):**
  - **Decision:** Added Personal Access Tokens (PATs) as a future feature.
  - **Rationale:** To enable programmatic access to individual user accounts, facilitating integrations like MCP servers for LLM-driven generative features.
  - **Impact:** Updated `projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`, and `activeContext.md` to include high-level considerations for PATs (e.g., API endpoints, security, DynamoDB storage for hashed tokens). `progress.md` updated to list PAT system design as a future task.
- **2025-05-16 (Design Spike & Skeleton Setup):**
  - **Decision:** Addressed open design questions regarding API Gateway caching, CloudWatch alarm thresholds, and DynamoDB GSI strategy for Tag-Post relationships. Updated `systemPatterns.md` and `activeContext.md` accordingly.
  - **Decision:** Established the initial project skeleton.
  - **Rationale:** To prepare the development environment and foundational tooling before implementing core features.
  - **Impact:**
    - Project initialized with `pnpm`.
    - Root `tsconfig.json` configured for `src/`.
    - AWS CDK project initialized in `infra/`.
    - `src/` directory created.
    - ESLint, Prettier, Husky, and lint-staged configured for code quality and pre-commit checks.
    - Basic GitHub Actions CI pipeline created for automated checks.
