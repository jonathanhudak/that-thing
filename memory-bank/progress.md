# Project Progress: Scalable API Service

## 1. Current Status
- **Phase:** Architectural Refinement & Design Finalization.
- **Overall Progress:** 0% (Code Implementation), 100% (Memory Bank Documentation Architecturally Enhanced).
- **Date:** 2025-05-16 (Corresponds to the latest update of this document)

## 2. What Works
- **Memory Bank Core Files (Architecturally Enhanced):**
    - All core files (`projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`, `activeContext.md`, `progress.md`) have been updated to incorporate detailed architectural enhancements based on the Solutions Architect review (`research/solutions-architect-findings-to-enhance-architecture.md`). This includes refined strategies for security, DynamoDB design, scalability, error handling, observability, cost management, API versioning, and testing.
- **Initial Idea Document:** `docs/initial-idea.md` (Serves as the source PRD).
- **Root README:** `README.md` providing an overview and links to the Memory Bank.

## 3. What's Left to Build (High-Level Roadmap from `activeContext.md`)
- **Validate Enhanced Architecture:** Review all updated Memory Bank documents for consistency and completeness.
- **Detailed Design Spike (If Needed):** Address any remaining specific design points (e.g., CloudWatch alarm thresholds, API Gateway cache TTLs).
- **Project Skeleton & Setup (TDD Approach, reflecting enhanced architecture):**
    - Initialize project with `pnpm` (`package.json`).
    - Configure TypeScript (`tsconfig.json`).
    - Initialize AWS CDK project structure (`infra/`, `src/`, `tests/`).
    - Set up ESLint, Prettier, Husky, Lint-Staged.
    - Implement CI/CD pipeline basics (e.g., GitHub Actions) including linting, formatting, and initial test runs.
- **Core Infrastructure & Features (TDD Approach):**
    - **Authentication (Cognito):** Implement CDK constructs.
    - **Database (DynamoDB):** Implement CDK constructs for the single table with defined GSIs.
    - **Observability Setup (CloudWatch, X-Ray):** Implement basic logging, metrics, and tracing setup.
    - **Core API (User Profile - e.g., `GET /v1/me`):** Implement Lambda, API Gateway endpoint, IAM roles.
    - Continue with other entities (Posts, Tags) following the TDD cycle, incorporating detailed access control, error handling, and other defined patterns.
- **Extended Testing:** Integrate load, security, and performance testing into the CI/CD pipeline.
- **Future Features (Post-MVP - Design Phase):**
    - **Personal Access Token (PAT) System:** High-level design and requirements gathering for PAT generation, storage, validation, and management APIs.

## 4. Known Issues / Blockers
- None at this exact moment, as development has not yet commenced. Potential future issues are detailed in the "Risks and Mitigations" section of `projectbrief.md`.
- Specific implementation details for some fine-grained configurations (e.g., cache TTLs, alarm thresholds) are pending final decisions during or just before implementation, as noted in `activeContext.md`.

## 5. Evolution of Project Decisions
- **2025-05-15 (Initial Setup):**
    - **Decision:** Initialize the Memory Bank.
    - **Rationale:** Establish a documented foundation.
    - **Impact:** Core Memory Bank files created.
- **2025-05-15 (User Feedback Integration):**
    - **Decisions:** Adopt `pnpm`, exclusive TDD, metadata-driven API docs.
    - **Rationale:** User preferences and requirements.
    - **Impact:** Core Memory Bank files updated.
- **2025-05-16 (Solutions Architect Review Integration):**
    - **Decision:** Incorporate comprehensive architectural enhancements based on `research/solutions-architect-findings-to-enhance-architecture.md`.
    - **Rationale:** To address potential gaps and ensure a robust, scalable, secure, and maintainable design before implementation, aligning with AWS best practices.
    - **Impact (Key Enhancements):**
        - **Security:** Detailed access control model (Cognito, Lambda auth logic, IAM least privilege, HTTPS), vulnerability monitoring considerations.
        - **DynamoDB Design:** Specific single-table schema with PK/SK structures, GSIs for key access patterns, and query examples.
        - **Scalability & Performance:** Strategies for Lambda optimization (provisioned concurrency, memory), DynamoDB (on-demand capacity, batch ops), API Gateway (throttling, caching).
        - **Error Handling & Resilience:** Standardized HTTP error codes, retry mechanisms for transient failures.
        - **Observability:** Comprehensive plan for logging (CloudWatch Logs), metrics (CloudWatch Metrics), alarms (CloudWatch Alarms), and tracing (AWS X-Ray).
        - **Cost Management:** Proactive monitoring with AWS Cost Explorer and Budgets.
        - **API Versioning:** Adopted path-based versioning (e.g., `/v1/`).
        - **Schema Evolution:** Planning for flexible schemas and batch migration strategies.
        - **Extended Testing:** Commitment to include load, security, and performance testing in CI/CD.
        - **Alternatives Considered:** Confirmed sticking with Lambda/DynamoDB for core functionality based on cost-effectiveness and suitability.
    - **Impact (Overall):** All core Memory Bank files (`projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`, `activeContext.md`, `progress.md`) significantly updated to reflect these detailed architectural decisions and considerations, providing a much stronger foundation for development.
- **2025-05-16 (Future Feature Identification):**
    - **Decision:** Added Personal Access Tokens (PATs) as a future feature.
    - **Rationale:** To enable programmatic access to individual user accounts, facilitating integrations like MCP servers for LLM-driven generative features.
    - **Impact:** Updated `projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`, and `activeContext.md` to include high-level considerations for PATs (e.g., API endpoints, security, DynamoDB storage for hashed tokens). `progress.md` updated to list PAT system design as a future task.
